Diagnostic biomarker model of severe malaria



The work is broken down into a few RMarkdown scripts:
* Data_Prep: this puts together the analysis datasets into a manageable set. This script can only be run with access to the original data files - this needs permission via data access committees (see details below)
* Mixture_modelling: this is the main meat and potatoes for the diagnostic model of severe malaria. This generates Figures 1 and 3 of the paper. More details are given below
* Direct_typed_Association_Study: association study using the directly typed SNPs
* Simulation_study: some initial simulations I did to estimate increases in power, ended up not including this in the main paper. Might be confusing!
